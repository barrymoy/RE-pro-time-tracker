For US tax purposes, to qualify for an exception to rental property as a passive activity, the rules below must be met.  The goal of this project is to create a tool for tracking real estate activity to help a person determine whether they qualify or not for this exception.

## Real Estate Professional Exception to Per Se Passive Categorization

`Rental activity is generally treated as a per se passive activity regardless of whether the taxpayer materially participates. Sec. 469(c)(2). However, pursuant to section 469(c)(7)(A)(i), the rental activity of a taxpayer is not treated as a per se passive activity if the taxpayer satisfies the requirements of section 469(c)(7)(B). A taxpayer meets those requirements if he or she establishes the following: `

`1. (i) more than one-half of the personal services performed in trades or businesses by the taxpayer during such taxable year are performed in real property trades or businesses in which the taxpayer materially participates, and `

`2. (ii) such taxpayer performs more than 750 hours of services during the taxable year in real property trades or businesses in which the taxpayer materially participates. In the case of a joint return, the requirements of the preceding sentence are satisfied if and only if either spouse separately satisfies such requirements. For purposes of the preceding sentence, activities in which a spouse materially participates shall be determined under subsection (h). `

`For purposes of section 469, a taxpayer is treated as materially participating in an activity if the taxpayer participates in the activity for more that 500 hours each year. See sec. 1.469-5T(a)(1), Temporary Income Tax Regs., 53 Fed. Reg. 5725-5726 (Feb. 25, 1988). `
